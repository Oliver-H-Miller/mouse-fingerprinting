For each device:
	We adjust two variables:
	The mouse DPI and the scroll amount
	
	For each setting (e.g. 800_dpi_high_scroll)
	Generate three graphs for a.csv, b.csv, c.csv
	
	From there we should be able to analyze if anything is significant based on the graphs and median/max/min for each variable
	
	What it should look like:
	
	(1) Scenario: Logitech G305 / 800 DPI / Regular Scroll
	[graph A, graph B, graph C]
	
	(2) Scenario: Logitech G305 / 1600 DPI / Regular Scroll
	[graph A, graph B, graph C]
		* continue for all the DPI settings *
		
	(n) Scenario: Logitech G305 / 800 DPI / High Scroll
	[graph A, graph B, graph C]
		* continue for all the scroll settings*
